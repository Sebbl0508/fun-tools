# Fun Tools
Currently there is a wheel of fortune, but i play to add more fun tools.

## State of the project
This is very WIP and screams for a refactoring, but for now it 'works'.

## How to run?
Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

Run dev
```
npm run dev
```

Build
```
npm run build
```
Then serve the files in the `dist/` directory statically.
